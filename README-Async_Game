For our game we picked Mancala.
We decided to not include the rule about capturing the opponent's stones, as we felt we had enough to do as it is.

The game is run by the server which sends move requests to the players along with the board and takes in the integer corresponding to the cup the player wants.
The server performs all of the turn logic, including deciding whether or not the player gets a second (third, etc...) turn and whether the game is over and then sends that to the player.

The game will start as soon as 2 players connect to the server, since we didn't have time to implement a proper lobby system. Player 1 is the first client to connect and will get the board first.
All the player needs to do is enter an integer between 1 and 6 (there is some input checking, though it's not perfect) and hit enter 
and the second player will get the board as of the end of the first player's turn.

When the game ends the players are asked whether they want to play again and both have to say yes (by entering "2") at which point the game will reset.
If one or both players say no then the game ends.
