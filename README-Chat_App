This is a simple, commandline-based chat application.
First, start the server and make sure it works. If the server starts sucsessfully, if will print out some information about itself 
like the port and the maximum number of clients that can connect to it

Before starting the client, make sure that the IP address that is in it matches that of the server (this will be made user-editable at a later stage)
After that start your clients and they should automatically connect to the server.

If you successfully connected to the server, you will be asked to enter your user name: follow the instructions on screen.
Hit Enter and you should now be able to type a message!

Messages you create have a few simple rules:
1)  You will be asked to enter the name of the recipient(s) - 
if you don't enter any names, the mesage will be broadcast to everyone connected even if you marked it as a private message
if you enter a name (or multiple) and mark the message as private, only that person will see it
if you enter a name (or multiple) and *don't* mark the message as private, it will be shown to everyone, but will have a note on top saying who it was addressed to
2)  Designate wether the message is private or not - messages marked as private will only be shown to the users you indicated as the recipients

When you are done, you can just close your client
